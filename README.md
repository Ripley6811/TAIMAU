TAIMAU Chemical Stock Tracking Program
======================================

This program was initially intended for keeping track of incoming and outgoing supplies and products.
Including tracking whether or not invoices and payments are completed.
At the same time, try to keep the process simple with few buttons and least number of keystrokes along with validation to reduce mistakes.

This is not intended as an financial accounting system but can be used to double-check figures.

Main features:
-SQLAlchemy database stores data on companies, products, shipments, invoices, and more.
-Simple main interface for doing the most common task of making a manifest.
-Each "product" in the database is designed for a specific company. May be more than one of the 'same' product in database.
-Add new companies and products or discontinue (cannot delete) a company or product (from showing in main interface).
-Interface can switch easily between Chinese and English.

Additional features:
-Make PDF of shipments over a time-range with company logo.
-Make PDF of product quality inspection results.
-TSC TTP-243E Plus label printing.
-View price changes for a product over time and compare with other companies.


Program is free to use but was designed for TAIMAU's operation.
